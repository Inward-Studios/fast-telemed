# fast-telemed





Currently, front end is made using flutter. There are 2 main reasons. First, much more comfortable in using flutter for an MVP rn than using react. Second, flutter lets us automatically make cross platform iOS, Android, and web apps, while still keeping the same front end. 

Not a designer, so welcome to any design changes later on!

To check it out, 
- clone the repo 
- `cd telemedfrontend`
- run `flutter run -d chrome`

Note, you will need to install flutter, but installing the xcode and android commandline tools is *not* needed.
